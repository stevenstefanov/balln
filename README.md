# Balln

## Project Description

Balln is a sports app leveraging 2 APIs, the first being the Basketball API which retrieves game statistics for a team and the second is the Ticketmaster API which retrieves the team's future games and ticket information. This will assist the user with getting their favorite NBA team's most updated stats and future gamesâ€™ ticket information.

## Background

I love watching and playing sports and thought it would be a really neat project to try building an app that would give some season statistics and ticket options. The basketball choice was another one of the team member's selections but it still achieved the desired goal that I had.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges was integrating the data from both APIs and translating the data and results from one API to get a result from the second one. Another challenge was that the team logos on the Basketball API were either different sizes or sometimes missing. However, saving all logos locally as .svg files solved that issue.

## Learnings

This was my first team project so I learned a lot about GitHub, version control and how to properly set up a repo with multiple contributors. I also learned a lot about how to read data being pulled from third-party APIs and how to apply it in my work.

## Usage
The app loads, the user is presented with a dropdown menu which will display a list of all NBA teams. Once the user selects their team and clicks on the `Submit` button, the app loads a page displaying information about the selected team's season statistics and future dated games with Ticketmaster link information.

## Credits

Credits go to my teammates on this project - Aboulaye Drabo, Eliezer Almonte, and Louis Falla. Thank you also to Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned.
